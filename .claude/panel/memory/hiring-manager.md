# Data Engineering Hiring Manager — Panel Memory

## Settled (do not relitigate)

- The README is the landing page and must survive the 90-second scan; docs must
  explain the *why* and the tradeoffs, not just the how — visible reasoning is the
  hire signal. (Recruiter-lens panel, PR #5.)
- Commit history is part of the portfolio: clear messages, coherent commit boundaries,
  visible decision points. (Recruiter-lens panel, PR #5.)
- The testing architecture (pytest for code offline / asset checks for data live,
  ERROR-vs-WARN severity discipline, `known_facts.py` single source) was chosen
  specifically because it *reads* as senior judgment — do not dilute it with framework
  sprawl or coverage theater. (Testing panel, PR #3.)

## Working knowledge

- Interview questions this repo currently answers well: "why two test layers?", "what
  happens when the upstream API changes?", "why no Great Expectations?", "why a
  single-file site?". Every new feature should either answer a new question or
  sharpen an existing answer.
- Signals still weak as of PR #5: README opens as a self-study workshop (reads
  tutorial-follower, undersells); screenshots don't yet show the 8 green asset checks
  (open item); the site's engineering craft is invisible to someone who only skims the
  repo — and the repo's pipeline is invisible to someone who only sees the site.
- The 90-second scan path to design for: recruiter opens README on a phone → headline
  + live site link → one architecture visual → one testing-philosophy paragraph →
  decides whether to open the site or the code.
