# Data Analyst — Panel Memory

## Settled (do not relitigate)

- Every number on the site must be derivable from the inline pipeline JSON; disclose
  denominators and nulls on-chart, not in footnotes. The runtime drift detector warns
  on any mismatch between data and copy. (First design panel, PR #1/#2.)
- Verified baselines: **82** people; **23** lack mass (of 82 — always with the
  denominator); Naboo **11**, Tatooine **10**; exactly **three** characters in all six
  films (C-3PO, R2-D2, Obi-Wan Kenobi); **42** of 82 appear in exactly one film;
  **19** of 82 flew at least one starship; max starships flown is **5** (Obi-Wan).
  (First design panel; frozen in `known_facts.py`, PR #3.)
- Height extremes: Yoda 66cm to Yarael Poof 264cm, with 1 person unmeasured. (Site
  beat 1, verified against snapshot.)

## Working knowledge

- Nulls are the story, not noise: the mass beeswarm's 23 missing values and the
  homeworld join's misses are disclosed in captions — this pattern must extend to any
  new claim.
- The drift detector (site/index.html ~481–497) recomputes
  {total, noMass, oneFilm, naboo, tatooine, pilots, maxFlown} from `DATA.people` and
  compares against hardcoded expectations, plus an exact-set check on the six-film
  trio. Any new on-site claim should be added there.
- Chart honesty conventions already in force: log scale flagged in the mass/scatter
  captions; excluded rows named (e.g. unmeasured/unweighed counts); the Chart/Table
  toggle exposes underlying rows for every dashboard card.
